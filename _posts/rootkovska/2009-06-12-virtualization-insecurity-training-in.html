VM escapes, hypervisor compromises (via "classic" rootkits, as well as Bluepill-like rootkits), hypervisor protection strategies, SMM attacks, TXT bypassing, and more â€” these are some of the topics that will be covered by our brand new training on Virtualization (In)Security at the upcoming Black Hat USA.<br /><br />The training offers quite a unique chance, I think, to absorb the results of 1+ year of the research done by our team within... just 2 days. This will be provided via detailed lectures and unique hands-on exercises.<br /><br />Unlike our previous training on stealth malware (that will also <a href="http://blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/train-bh-usa-09-jrk-at.html">be offered</a> this year, BTW), this time we will offer attendees a bit of hope :) We will be stressing that some of the new hardware technologies (Intel TXT, VT, TPM), if used properly, have potential to dramatically increase security of our computer systems. Sure, we will be showing attacks against those technologies (e.g. TXT), but nevertheless we will be stressing that this is the proper way to go in the long run.<br /><br />Interestingly, I'm not aware of any similar training of this kind, that would be covering the security issues related to virtualization systems and bare metal hypervisors. Hope we will not get into troubles with the Antitrust Commission for monopolizing this field ;)<br /><br />The training brochure (something for your boss) is <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/training_virtsec/VirtSecTraining-Overview.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />The detailed agenda spanning 2 full days can be downloaded <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/training_virtsec/VirtSecTraining-Agenda-0.9.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />The Black Hat signup page is <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-usa-09/train-bh-usa-09-jrk-virt.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ti3q3Hdvels/SjJF-ePDEUI/AAAAAAAAAEo/5ealWjYcCn4/s320/neurons.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5346412647212585282" />
