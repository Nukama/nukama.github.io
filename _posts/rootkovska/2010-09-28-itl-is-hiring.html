We're looking to hire one or two full time developers, who will be working on the open source version of <a href="http://www.qubes-os.org/Home.html">Qubes OS</a>, with the primary task of advancing it from Alpha to Beta stage, and then finally to a production quality version.<br /><br />We're looking to hire <span style="font-style: italic;">developers</span>, not necessarily security researchers! Specifically we expect the following from candidates:<br /><ul><li>Many years of experience with Linux/GNU development, including system-level and kernel-level Linux development, documented by the actual projects,<br /></li><li>Familiarity with virtualization technologies, and specifically with Xen hypervisor,</li><li>Basic understanding of the Qubes architecture and excitement about the project :)</li><li>Product-oriented approach (polishing, testing, packaging, understanding of user needs),</li><li>Good communication skills in written English<br /></li></ul>In return we offer the following benefits:<br /><ul><li>Decent, full-time salary,</li><li>Opportunity to be part of a <a href="http://www.invisiblethingslab.com/itl/About.html">renown security team</a>,</li><li>Opportunity to work on an exciting product,<br /></li><li>Work on a GPLed project with all the benefits it gives to the developer (visibility, rights to the code)</li></ul>If you're interested in joining our team, please send a message to joanna at invisiblethingslab.com.<br /><br />Please do not send typical resumes: don't write about schools you finished, certificates you obtained, driving license, scuba trainings, etc. We are only interested in a short bio (keep it below 100 words please), <span style="font-weight: bold;">and links to your past or current projects</span>. Include your geographic location.<br /><br />While it would be great if you were based in Warsaw (or somewhere in Poland), as it would allow for regular face-to-face meetings, this is not a critical factor. ITL doesn't have a physical office, and everybody work from their apartments, so there is no need to relocate to Warsaw, in case you happened to be based somewhere else.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://xkcd.com/664/"><img style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 206px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ti3q3Hdvels/TKHbgfsTIKI/AAAAAAAAAGY/x5QFRMysCTE/s400/academia_vs_business.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5521935969442537634" border="0" /></a>
