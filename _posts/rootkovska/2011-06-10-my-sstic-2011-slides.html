A few days ago I had a privilege to give an opening keynote at the <a href="http://www.sstic.org/2011/programme/">SSTIC conference</a> in Rennes, France, which is believed by many to be the most important security conference in France. You can find my slides <a href="http://www.invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2011/SSTIC%202011.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />SSTIC seems to be a very interesting conference indeed, with a strong emphasis on system-level security, which is quite unusual these days where most conferences focus on networking, apps, and web-apps. What a pity all those interestingly-looking talks have been encoded in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">obscure language</a> used only by some 3% of the population of the planet...<br /><br />Anyway, it was a pleasure to talk to some <a href="http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/">ANSSI</a> people I met before the conference (one of the organizers of the event) who really seemed to understand well the challenges we face with building secure operating systems, and generally seemed well versed in the topic. Perhaps some other nations should learn from France, instead of proposing ridiculous and superficial <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13614125">means</a> that can't really solve any real problem.
