<p>At the beginning of this year, at Black Hat Federal Conference, I proposed a simple taxonomy that could be used to classify stealth malware according to how it interacts with the operating system. Since that time I have often referred to this classification as I think it is very useful in designing system integrity verification tools and to talk about malware in general. Now I decided to explain this classification a bit more as well as extend it of a new type of malware - the type III malware.</p><p>The article is available as a PDF document <a href="http://invisiblethings.org/papers/malware-taxonomy.pdf">here</a>.</p><br /><br /><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/2196/3001/1600/708009/malware%20taxonomy%20500px.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
