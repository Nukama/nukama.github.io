I can't believe <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080519-google-health-beta-launches-with-security-issues-looming.html">this</a> is happening for real... <br /><br />So, how can we enforce Google to never do read() on a <code>/var/users/john_smith/heath_records.db</code>? How about a read() implemented from within a kernel-level via RAW-disk access that would never be logged?<br /><br />I wonder when we would get another cool service from Google, e.g. "Google Thoughts", where people would be able to store their most private and personal thoughts, so that they could "access and managed them from all over the world", "in a secure fashion", of course. Right, add the Thought Police to this picture and welcome to Orwell's Oceania!<br /><br />There is a difference between using the Web for blog writing vs. giving away all the private aspects of your life for free to some corporation in an unencrypted form. I wonder whether all the people who understands the notion of the local hard disk will be vaporized some time...
