I’m very happy to announce that a well known researcher, Rafal Wojtczuk, will join our team this month.<br /><br />For anybody who is serious about OS security research it is hard not to know Rafal’s work. I remember reading his <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1998/Feb/0006.html"><em>Defeating Solar Designer non-executable stack patch</em> article</a> somewhere around 1998, when I was still a Linux newbie, learning shell programming back at that time ;) <br /><br />Since then Rafal published many other articles, advisories and exploits, mostly Linux-related. To mention just a few – the <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Jan/0348.html">*BSD procfs vulnerability</a> (2000), the <a href="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2001/Oct/0135.html">Linux Ptrace vulnerability</a> (2001), the famous <a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=58&id=4#article">Advanced return-into-lib(c) paper</a> (2002), the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/list-archive/att-4468/description.txt">vulnerability in the SELinux</a> (2003), <a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/563.en.html">a tool</a> for automatic integer overflow discovery in Win32 binaries (2005) and many others. He’s also known for his <a href="http://libnids.sourceforge.net/">libnids project</a>.<br /><br />Recently Rafal has been doing a lot of research in the area of virtualization and VMM security. In the recent months he found vulnerabilities that potentially allowed to escape a VM jail in all the major virtualization software from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS07-049.mspx">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/misc/threat_center/vmware_advisory1.pdf">VMWare</a> and, of course, <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/local_content/misc/threat_center/e2fsprogs.pdf">Xen</a>.<br /><br />I wrote “and, of course, Xen”, as Rafal will be presenting a talk at the upcoming Black Hat about <em>Subverting the Xen hypervisor</em>. His talk will be the first one in the series of 3 presentations about Xen (in)security that Invisible Things Lab prepared for this year’s Black Hat. Stay tuned for more details in the coming days.<br /><br />Rafal has been with McAfee Avert Labs until this month.
