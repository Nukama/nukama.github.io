The new press release covering the basic details about our TXT attack is <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-02.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />The paper is <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20paper.pdf">here</a>.<br /><br />The slides converted to a PDF format are <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20slides.pdf">here</a>. There is also an original version of slides in the Keynote format <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20slides.key.zip">here</a> for the Mac people. And for all the other people who don't use Mac, but still value the aesthetics (?!), I have also generated a QuickTime clickable movie out from the Keynote slides -- it can be found <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09dc/Attacking%20Intel%20TXT%20-%20slides.mov">here</a>, but it weighs 80MB.<br /><br />Enjoy.
